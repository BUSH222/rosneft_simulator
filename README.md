# Rosneft Simulator

## Description

Welcome to the Rosneft Simulator, a game developed for PyWeek 37 with the theme "tubes". This game is set in Russia and you play as [Rosneft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosneft), a large company responsible for a [significant portion of the country's oil production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_industry_in_Russia). The goal of the game is to export as much oil as possible from Russia and get rich.

## Gameplay

In this game, Rosneft is the only company and spawns on a random [oil reservoir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_reservoir). There is also an export pipe on the bottom or left side of Russia. Any oil that flows into this pipe gets exported and is directly converted into money.

As a player, you have four options (right menu):

1. **Buy Land**: Oil rigs can only be built on bought land.
2. **Survey Land**: Find oil on which to build the oil rigs.
3. **Build Pipe**: Build and sell pipes to export the oil.
4. **Build Oil Rig**: Build an oil rig to start drilling for oil.

At the top there are information panels:
1. Oil percentage - how much oil Russia still has left.
2. Budget - how much money your company still has
3. Net income - how much money your company is making.

Every placed object and bought land require upkeep. Every action costs some money. Oil reservoirs have a certain amount of oil in them and they run out over time.

## Tutorial

Color scheme:
- oil: grey colored tiles, only visible after being bought and surveyed
- buy land: When selecting buying land, you can select a square on the map to buy. When selecting that square, the prices of tiles will appear yellow in color. The darker the yellow, the less expensive it is. Grey tiles mean that part of the map was already bought.
- survey land: same as buy land, but the price to survey the land is the same for every tile, except bought tiles.
- build rigs and pipes: when first building pipes or rigs, a preview will appear. If the preview is red, you can't place pipes or a rig. If it is green - you can.
- Export pipe - a black tile with a yellowish pipe on it will generate randomly somewhere on the left or bottom side of Russia.

Here's a quick start guide to playing the game:

1. Start by placing one or several oil rigs on the grey colored tiles.
2. Connect them to the export pipe (remember, the export pipe is a black tile somewhere on the left or bottom side of Russia)
3. Expand by buying more land. Click on 'Buy Land' and expand your territory.
4. Once you've bought the land, you can survey it to find oil. Click on the 'Survey Land' button and then select a square of bought land you want to survey.
5. Repeat until the percentage of oil at the top left (the total oil Russia has left) hits 0!

Remember, every action costs money and every object and bought land require upkeep, so manage your resources wisely!

## Conclusion

We hope you enjoy playing Rosneft Simulator and get a glimpse into the world of oil production and export. Good luck and have fun!
